Jason's minimalistic buy/sell indicator: 
1) We want to cut out volatility noise of a green bar in a downtrend and a red bar in an uptrend:  
    if the bar closes above the EMA color it green  
    if the bar closes below the EMA color it red 

2) We want early exit signals caution if we are in a trade and the trend may reverse:  
  if in an uptrend and stochastic rsi crosses while above 80 signal a caution potential reversal  
  if in a downtrend and stochastic rsi crosses while below the 20 signal a caution potential reversal  

3) We want buy and sell signals at beginning of potential new trends  
 if bar closes above EMA and stochastic RSI has crossed while below the 20: BUY  
 if bar closes below EMA and stochastic RSI has crossed while above the 80: SHORT
